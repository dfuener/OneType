# OneType
Imagine just One Type

One type is a string, one type is an integer, one type is an object, one type is a list, one type is a sorted list, one type is XML, one type is JSON.   

OneType is a semantic generic data type originally developed for transactions within compoent based software systems. It was then expaned to carry transactions between disimilar systems as well as web services.  It has proven to handle millions of transactions installed in the field.

This project intends to create a fully documented and fully function version of the OneType data object.  The first phase of code which is the data object module has been completed.  The objects code now has to be fully documented for use.
